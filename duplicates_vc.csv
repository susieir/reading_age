"Tuesday, 1st December 1215 THE TROUBADOUR SPECIAL SOUVE ROCHESTER REBELS NIR EDITION SURRENDER After nearly two months trapped inside Rochester Castle, the rebel garrison laid down their arms yesterday and surrendered to the forces of King John. In the end it wasn’t siege engines or battering rams that defeated them, but hunger Emerging from the keep with their arms raised, the survivors appeared pale and weak from lack of food, yet they managed to keep their pride and dignity, winning the respect of their former foes, One elderly chronicler, who has witnessed more than his share of castle siege was heard to say: ‘Our age has not known a siege so hard-pressed nor so bravely resisted ...’ According to unconfirmed reports, the King initially planned to execute all the rebels, but was dissuaded from doing so by his chief advisor, Captain Savari de Mauléon, Perhaps the captain feared that this would lead to revenge killings of the Toyalist prisoners in rebel prisons. We understand the remaining rebels are currently under guard, awaiting transportation to the dungeons of Corfe Castle and other castles controlled by the King, So, the defence of Rochester was undermined by... undermining! Our main takeaway from this siege is the importance of building on rock, or surrounding your castle with a moat — anything to thwart those terrifying cunnellers!

There followed many battles between England and France; the English kings tried to take over large areas of France and the French kings tried to reclaim their lands. b2RF B F Monarchs of be Fes § g England from 2g £22 2 2 1066-1300 : NOOce 1200ce 1300ce Kings relied on noblemen to fight battles and defend lands on their behalf. William the Conqueror had made lots of his Norman followers into nobles called ‘barons, and they built strong castles in order to show off their power and keep control of the people.

So, in the 13th century the English kings were fighting battles against Prance and sometimes fighting against their own barons too, Let’s look at some of the sieges which took place in the 1200s to learn more and to see how having good castle defences can change the course of history! 26 So you want to build a Castle",2

The first castles were made of wood, with walls of wood and earth. They could be built quickly, and building in wood is alot cheaper than building in stone. The problem is that wood rots, and it also burns. As a result, most wooden castles didn’t last very long. You should probably build your castle with stone! So you want to build a Castle",1
